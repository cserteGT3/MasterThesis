# Ray tracing

This module enables ray tracing on CSG-trees defined in [CSGBuilding.jl](https://github.com/cserteGT3/CSGBuilding.jl).

**This module is written by @freemin7, author of the [SignedDistanceFields.jl](https://github.com/freemin7/SignedDistanceFields.jl) package.**
Original source is the [example folder of that package](https://github.com/freemin7/SignedDistanceFields.jl/tree/master/example/raytracer).
I only changed things to get it work with `CSGNode`s (defined in `CSGBuilding.jl`).
